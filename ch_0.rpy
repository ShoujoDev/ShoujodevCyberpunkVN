    My earliest memory that I can recall...
    
    I sat in a small room with white walls and plush white carpet. A pile of toys that was scattered from one end to the other surrounded me.
    
    I remember that I held in my tiny hands one of the small plastic toys that I was fond of. A tiny model of a highchair.
    
    I clearly remember investigating it from all angles. At the time, I didn't know what it was.
    
    Maybe my infant brain was enamored with the turquois colour of the seat, or the smooth texture of the plastic. But I do recall that none of my other figures could fit into the seat.
    
    None of them were of the same scale. Most of them were too big.
    
    And then I looked up, and I saw two people I didn't recognize, but who also seemed familiar, observing me from the doorway.

    He lowered his gaze from the massive digital screens that stood surrounding the city center.
    
    And everyone else did the same. They lowered their collective gazes to the mobile devices they held in their hands, and they continued on with their daily commute.

    # Nathan wants to change the world, and Jonas is like "no you're not you're 12"
    # Jonas is out to pick up some soykaf for Natalie
    # He meets Nathan while out
    # While bullying him the digital screen glitches out
    # Jonas suddenly gets a message from the Mentor to pull up because there's been a massive dataleak

    Nathan "Do you think they believe that?"
    Jonas "What's that?"
    Nathan "On the big screens. Do you think they really believe that garbage?"
    """
    [Jonas] shrugged his shoulders.
    """
    Nathan "Don't you feel sorry for them?"
    Jonas "No?"
    
    """
    A man in a business suit suddenly pushed passed the two, shouldering his body in between them. He grumbled about something or other underneath his breath.
    """
    
    Nathan "Hey, watch it!"
    Jonas "Cool it, kid."
    Nathan "But-!!"
    Jonas "We're in the center of the Sprawl. If you stick your head out, someone's gonna cut it off for you."
    Nathan "Prrrrrft... Yeah, whatever."
    Jonas "You're the one who wanted to come out here with me. Now follow my rules, or I'll have them put a marker on you."
    Nathan "What the !@#$. No way you'd do that to me."
    
    """
    But the expression on [Jonas]'s face coupled with the disturbing silence that followed conveyed the seriousness of his words to poor [Nathan].
    """

    Jonas "Look, as far as I'm concerned, it's their choice to live like cattle."
    
    """
    And as [Jonas] said that, a group of young school children all walking together like baby ducks in a line passed by the pair.
    
    Each child greeted both [Jonas], and [Nathan] with a happy smile and a cute little wave. These kids had no cares in the world, and it showed.
    """
    
    Nathan "...Even those kids? Do you think they had a choice?"
    Jonas "Whatever./ [Jonas] clicked his tongue. / They're the kids of proles. They'll grow up to be proles."
    Nathan "...That's not fair to them. That's not fair to anyone."
    Jonas "Oh yeah? And what are you gonna do about it? You're like twelve, kid."
    Nathan "I'm not a kid, I'm fourteen!!!"
    Jonas "Whatever. Just do what I say, and quit making a scene."
    Nathan "No! I'm tired of you bein' so negative all the damn time. I'm just- I'm done with you, okay! I'm done. I'll stop bothering you cus I'm just a stupid little kid."
    
    """
    [Nathan] stormed off. He quickly disappeared in the sea of much taller bodies, and [Jonas] didn't much feel like going after him.
    
    Maybe it was sheer arrogance, or maybe he just truly didn't care much for the kid who often toed after him like a lost puppy dog. [Jonas] knew that the kid would be back.
    
    He always came crawling back after he got over his tantrum.
