    My earliest memory that I can recall...
    
    I remember that I sat in a small room with white walls and plush white carpet. I was surrounded by a pile of toys that was scattered from one end of the room to the other.
    
    I remember that I was fond of this one figure. I held it in my tiny hands; A tiny model of a highchair.
    
    I clearly remember investigating it from all angles. At the time, I didn't know what it was.
    
    Maybe my infant brain was enamored with the turquois colour of the seat, or the smooth texture of the plastic. But I do recall that none of my other figures could fit into the seat.
    
    None of them were the same scale. Most of them were too big, and the others were too small.
    
    When I finally grew bored of trying to fit figures of people into the chair, my wandering eyes moved to the doorway. I saw two people I didn't recognize - but who also seemed familiar - observing me.

    He lowered his gaze from the massive digital screens that stood tall and oppressive - overlooking the city center as if four unyielding gods - and the surrounding people did the same.
    
    The crowd lowered their collective gazes to the mobile devices that they held in their hands, and pedestrian traffic continued on like nothing had happened.

    {i}This world... Really is disgusting.{/i} That's what he thought as he observed the people around him. A contemptable sneer plastered on his pale face, and he didn't try to hide it.
    
    [Jonas] Ality felt as if he were the only person in the world who was aware of his own self. He felt as if he were the only person who truly was alive. [Jonas] felt as if--

    # Nathan wants to change the world, and Jonas is like "no you're not you're 12"
    # Jonas is out to pick up some soykaf for Natalie
    # He meets Nathan while out
    # While bullying him the digital screen glitches out
    # Jonas suddenly gets a message from the Mentor to pull up because there's been a massive dataleak

    Nathan "Huh. Stackos are on sale. Two for $8.50."
    Jonas "What?"
    Nathan "On the big screen. They just advertised it. And that Konbeni over there just sent a notification about it to my Navi."
    """
    He showed his mobile device to [Jonas].
    """
    Jonas "Do you hear yourself right now?"
    Nathan "Huh? I just thought it was a good deal, I dunno..."
    Jonas "You're actually retarded."
    
    """
    [Jonas] trudged off into the crowd.
    
    The kid toeing after him was [Nathan], a local street kid that looked up to [Jonas] like he was the older brother he never had.
    """
    
    Nathan "Hey, slow down- You can just tell me, you know! I got ears."
    Jonas "... Whatever. You just don't get it."
    Nathan "What don't I get?"
    Jonas ". . ."
    
    """
    For some reason, [Jonas] clammed up. He was avoiding eye contact, and that sour look on his face made it look like he was sulking.
    
    Suddenly a man in a business suit pushed passed the two, shouldering his body in-between them, grumbling about something or other underneath his breath.
    """
    
    Nathan "Hey, watch it!"
    Jonas "{i}[Nathan].{/i}"
    Nathan "What!!"
    Jonas "Cool it."
    Nathan "Tttch..."
    Jonas "Just let it go. Remember, they have eyes everywhere."
    
    """
    [Nathan] went quiet, and he looked around, but no one was looking at them. If somebody was, they weren't making it obvious.
    """

    Nathan "Geeze..."
    Jonas "Now shut up and stay close."
    Nathan "But I wanted to look around a bit! It's not like I get to come to the Emp every day."
    """
    Jonas sighed.
    """
    Jonas "We can look around after."
    Nathan "Oh, really? Great!"
    
    """
    Satisfied with their new arrangement, [Nathan] happily trotted along after [Jonas] as the two boys made their way through the Empyrean.
    """
    
    """
    Even though it was only about 10 AM on a weekday, the central district was as packed as it's ever been.
    
    [Jonas] had thought that if he came during the morning during work hours, the crowds wouldn't be as bad, but what he read online was completely wrong.
    
    Wageslaves, and business men trudged onwards to their fate as a cog in the upper levels of the machine that was the Emp.
    
    Part timers checked in to their minimum wage customer service jobs; entry-level fare for a newly christened prole, fresh out of school and eager to join the work force.
    
    Then there were the sightseers, and tourists.
    
    Sometimes people from the residential floors of the Emp came down looking for a day out on the town, or they were commuting out to the Sprawl that surrounded the city for an even greater thrill.
    
    Even still, there were people from the Sprawl that came out to the Emp to do a bit of shopping, or because they worked there.
    """
    
    """
    As for [Jonas] and [Nathan], their destination was in the artisan strip, a little cafe that sold real coffee, imported from the Arabian Peninsula. Not the synthetic soykaf sludge being peddled by the media as a cheaper replacement.
    """
    
    """
    [Jonas] went up to the counter, hands in his pockets.
    
    The girl at the counter regarded him wryly, and she waited there with disinterest, looking at her phone.
    
    [Jonas] stood there for a few moments more, before he finally spoke up,
    """
    
    Jonas "I'm here to pick up my order."
    "We get a lot of orders here, kid. Gonna have to be more specific."
    
    """
    He shuffled around in his pocket and then took out his Navi. He pulled up the digital receipt on the screen and showed it to her.
    
    When the girl saw his mechanical arm, she raised a brow.
    """
    
    "Cool aug. You have balls coming here with something like that painting a target on your back."
    
    """
    Although her tone wasn't the kindest, she was right. Mechanical augments weren't just seen as ugly here in the Emp, they were a clear marker that the owner lived out in the Sprawl.
    
    Empyrean citizens usually took to all natural augments, the kind that used synthetic skin grown from human tissue, with a mechanical skeleton underneath. 
    
    These kind of prosthetics were usually indistinguishable from a natural human limb, and they were far more common than most people thought.
    """
    
    Jonas "Thanks."
    
    """
    The girl at the counter snorted, and then she retreated to the back for a moment.
    """
    """
    [Nathan] was looking at a touch screen news outlet set up for customers to peruse while they sipped their drink.
    
    He laughed when he found an article about an athlete that he didn't like, exposed for having a body that was mostly prosthetic.
    """
    
    Nathan "Damn, I knew he was fake, but I didn't think he'd go all Terminator on us. Check this out-"
    
    """
    The girl returned with the package, safely tucked away in a brown paper bag.
    """
    
    "Would you like your receipt?"
    Jonas "No. Thanks."
    
    """
    But when he went to take his stuff, the girl snatched it away from him. She leaned in from across the counter to whisper into his ear.
    """
    
    "Ya know, if you'd like to get that thing touched up... I know a guy..."
    
    """
    [Jonas] made a face, and he quickly grabbed his bag.
    """
    
    Jonas "No thanks. C'mon, [Nathan]."
    
    """
    The boy who watched the interaction had an uneasy look on his face, but he quietly followed on after [Jonas] when he left.
    
    When they were out of the store and walking back along the artisan strip, he opened his mouth to speak again.
    """
    
    Nathan "Sheesh, what was all that about-"
    Jonas "This is why I don't like coming here."
    Nathan "Huh? Really? I think she was into you."
    Jonas "..."
    Nathan "Ooh- What's that smell? Hey, can we go in there?"
    
    """
    [Nathan] came to a stop as they passed a colourful shoppe that smelled exquisite. Like candy and fruit had a deliciously sweet smelling baby.
    
    [Jonas] read the sign, and he mumbled,
    """
    Jonas "...It's a soap store."
    """
    But [Nathan] didn't hear him, or he chose not to listen. The kid ran into the store, and he threw caution to the wind.
    
    [Jonas] decided that he'd simply wait outside.
    """
    """
    ...     ...
    ...     ...
    """
    """
    It wasn't long until store security was called, and carried [Nathan] out by the scruff.
    
    He was eating the soaps, and consequentially banned from all locations within the Emp.
    
    [Jonas], with a blank expression on his face, couldn't help but to ask his sorry faced friend,
    """
    Jonas "Was it worth it?"
    Nathan "... Yes."
    """
    [Jonas] sighed through his nose, and a smile had finally crept onto his face.
    """
    
    Jonas "C'mon, let's go look around a bit more."
    
    """
    The two boys spent some time browsing around different stores, just window shopping for the sake of it.
    
    [Jonas] made sure to show [Nathan] some of the more interesting landmarks of the Empyrean tower.
    
    The theme park, for example was a standout eye catcher. Although it didn't seem to be operating currently.
    
    [Nathan] had even wandered into a store with odd decorative vases in the storefront.
    
    When he came out, he was visibly shaken. [Jonas] snickered, and asked him what he saw. [Nathan] didn't want to talk about it.
    """
    
    """
    Throughout the outing, [Nathan] was having a lot of fun, and while [Jonas] wouldn't use the word - nor would he ever admit to it - he was having fun, too.
    
    Eventually they stopped to catch their breath on an overlook that resided over the greater part of the shopping district.
    """
    
    Nathan "Wow, the Emp is great. It really has it all."
    Jonas "Mh."
    Nathan "I think when I get my own job, I wanna come live and work here."
    Jonas "Pffft."
    Nathan "Huh? What's so funny?"
    Jonas "You wanna become a wageslave?"
    Nathan "What? No, that's not what I said!"
    Jonas "You said you wanted to get a job and work in the Emp."
    Nathan "Yeah, and so what? What's the problem with that?"
    Jonas "It's... /[Jonas] couldn't put into words what he wanted to say right away. /Just look around you. Do they look happy?"
    
    """
    Looking down at the people below them, [Nathan] saw a couple sharing a tender moment moment on a bench. He saw coworkers exchanging small talk on break. He saw people with smiles on their faces, just living their lives.
    """
    
    Nathan "Well... Yeah. They just look like normal people."
    Jonas "Tch."
    Nathan "What's wrong?"
    Jonas "You don't understand me. You're still just a little kid."
    Nathan "What am I trying to understand?!"
    Jonas "They're proles! They're all fucking miserable on the inside, and choosing to live like cattle is the only way they can trick themselves into thinking that they're alive!"

    """
    And as [Jonas] said that, a group of young school children all walking together like baby ducks in a line passed by the pair.
    
    Each child greeted both [Jonas], and [Nathan] with a happy smile and a cute little wave. These kids had no cares in the world, and it showed.
    """
    
    Nathan "...Even those kids? Do you think that's their choice, too?"
    Jonas "Whatever./ [Jonas] clicked his tongue. / They're the kids of proles. They'll grow up to be proles."
    Nathan "...And how do you know that? You know what I think? I think you're the one who's miserable and you're just projecting because you're locked up in your room all damn day. I bet if you actually went out once in a while and talked to some of them, you'd see that they're just fine!"
    Jonas "Shut up, already. You don't know anything, you're, like, twelve."
    Nathan "No I'm not, I'm fourteen!!!"
    Jonas "Whatever. Just shut up and quit making a scene."
    Nathan "No! I'm tired of you bein' so negative all the damn time. I'm done."
    
    """
    [Nathan] stormed off, disappearing as he slid down an escalator, and into the sea of people. [Jonas] wasn't the type of person who'd chase after him.
    
    Maybe it was sheer arrogance, or maybe he just didn't care much for the kid who often toed after him like a lost puppy dog, but [Jonas] knew that the kid would be back.
    
    He always came crawling back to him.
